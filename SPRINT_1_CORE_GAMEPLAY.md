2. Character Progression (leveling, skill trees)
3. AI Memory System (persistent storage, relationship tracking)

### Week 2: Core Systems
1. Combat Engine (turn-based mechanics, spells)
2. Inventory Management (crafting, equipment stats)
3. Emotional Intelligence (mood tracking, empathy)

### Week 3: Integration & Polish
1. Save/Load System (comprehensive state management)
2. World Persistence (consequence system, continuity)
3. Achievement System (progress tracking, analytics)

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks:
- **3D Dice Performance**: Have fallback 2D animations
- **AI Memory Complexity**: Start with simple relationship tracking
- **Save System Complexity**: Implement incremental saves gradually

### User Experience Risks:
- **Feature Overload**: Implement progressive disclosure
- **Learning Curve**: Create comprehensive tutorials
- **Performance Impact**: Optimize for mobile devices

## Next Steps

1. **Mark Sprint 1 tasks as in-progress**
2. **Begin with Enhanced Dice System** (highest user impact)
3. **Set up development branch** for Sprint 1 features
4. **Create detailed component specifications** for each feature
5. **Establish testing protocols** for new systems
