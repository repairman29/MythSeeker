- ✅ Modular architecture

## 🚀 Pre-Deployment Checklist

### **1. Code Quality**
- [ ] Run `npm run lint` and fix any remaining issues
- [ ] Run `npm run type-check` for TypeScript validation
- [ ] Verify all service integrations work correctly
- [ ] Test all routes and navigation flows

### **2. Service Integration**
- [ ] Verify `stateManagerService` persistence works
- [ ] Test `toastService` notifications across all user flows
- [ ] Validate `navigationService` breadcrumbs and routing
- [ ] Run integration tests: `integrationTester.runAllTests()`

### **3. Performance**
- [ ] Check bundle size after refactoring
- [ ] Verify lazy loading still works correctly
- [ ] Test Hot Module Replacement (HMR)
- [ ] Monitor memory usage with new state management

### **4. User Experience**
- [ ] Test all user flows end-to-end
- [ ] Verify no functionality was lost in refactoring
- [ ] Check responsive design across all new components
- [ ] Test accessibility features

### **5. Backend Integration**
- [ ] Verify Firebase connections still work
- [ ] Test authentication flows
- [ ] Validate campaign and character data persistence
- [ ] Check multiplayer functionality

## 📊 Deployment Commands

### **Development Testing**
```bash
# Clear caches and start fresh
rm -rf node_modules/.vite node_modules/.cache dist .firebase/hosting.*
npm install
npm run dev

# Run integration tests
# Tests will auto-run in development mode
```

### **Production Build**
```bash

## 📞 Support

If any issues arise during deployment:
1. Check the integration test results
2. Verify all services are properly initialized
3. Review the service dependency chain
4. Check browser console for specific error messages

The microservice architecture is designed to be resilient and provide clear error reporting to facilitate quick issue resolution.
