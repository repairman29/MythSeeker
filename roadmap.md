# MythSeeker UI/UX Improvement Roadmap

Below are 10 UI/UX improvement ideas for MythSeeker. These are not yet prioritized into sprints, but are intended for future planning and discussion.

1. **Contextual Tooltips for All Interactive Elements**
   - Extend tooltips to all buttons, icons, and form fields that aren't immediately clear, improving discoverability and usability across the app.

2. **Visual and Auditory Feedback for All Actions**
   - Expand the existing animation and notification system to provide distinct visual and subtle auditory feedback for all user interactions (e.g., button clicks, saves, errors, combat actions, inventory changes) to make the app feel more responsive and alive.

3. **Enhanced Character Sheet Customization and Visuals**
   - Allow users to upload or select a character portrait and visually see equipped items on a character model (even a simple 2D one), boosting immersion and personalization.

4. **Interactive World Map with Discovered Locations**
   - Fully implement the WorldMap component with clickable locations, clear pathways, and visual indicators for discovered/undiscovered areas to enhance exploration and world understanding.

5. **Improved Combat Visuals and Information Overlay**
   - Add clearer visual indicators for attack ranges, movement paths, and target selection. Overlay combat logs and status effects directly onto the map or combatants for more intuitive battles.

6. **Dynamic UI Theming Based on Campaign Environment**
   - Extend background gradient theming to recolor UI elements, change icons, or even adjust fonts based on the selected campaign theme for greater aesthetic polish and immersion.

7. **More Granular Settings and Accessibility Options**
   - Expand the Settings tab to include font size, colorblind modes, animation preferences, and customizable keybindings, making the app more accessible and user-friendly.

8. **In-Game Tutorial/FTUE System Refinement**
   - Develop a more integrated FTUE system with guided tours, mini-challenges, and progressive feature reveals to onboard new players more effectively.

9. **Enhanced Multiplayer Lobby and Player Status Displays**
   - Make the multiplayer lobby more dynamic and visually engaging, showing connected players, their characters, and ready statuses with avatars or character icons.

10. **Drag-and-Drop for Inventory and Equipment Management**
    - Implement drag-and-drop functionality for moving items between inventory slots and equipment, providing a more intuitive and tactile user experience.

# MythSeeker Non-UI/UX Improvement Roadmap

Below are 10 non-UI/UX improvements that could significantly enhance the MythSeeker app. These are not yet prioritized into sprints, but are intended for future planning and discussion.

1. **Implement Robust Firestore Security Rules**
   - Replace permissive Firestore rules with granular, production-ready rules that restrict access based on authentication, ownership, and campaign participation/host status to ensure data security and privacy.

2. **Full Integration and Optimization of Vertex AI Gemini Pro for AI DM**
   - Ensure a robust, stable, and highly performant connection to Vertex AI for all AI Dungeon Master responses, supporting advanced context-aware storytelling and dynamic world state updates.

3. **Advanced Combat System Logic (Line of Sight, Enemy AI, Tactical Positioning)**
   - Enhance the combat system with precise line-of-sight calculations, more complex enemy AI behaviors, and deeper tactical positioning (cover, terrain effects) for greater combat depth and challenge.

4. **Comprehensive Input Validation and Sanitization on Cloud Functions**
   - Implement rigorous server-side validation and sanitization for all user-submitted data in Cloud Functions to prevent malicious data injection and ensure data integrity.

5. **Implement Server-Side Rate Limiting for Cloud Functions**
   - Add rate limiting to Firebase Cloud Functions to protect against abuse, manage costs (especially for AI API calls), and ensure fair usage for all users.

6. **Dynamic Quest Generation and Management Logic**
   - Develop backend logic for dynamically generating quests, managing quest branching based on player choices, and implementing complex consequences for quest outcomes.

7. **Robust Error Handling, Monitoring, and Logging for Backend Services**
   - Build a comprehensive system for logging errors, performance monitoring, and alerting in Cloud Functions and database operations to aid debugging and maintain production reliability.

8. **Persistent World State Evolution and Consequence System**
   - Create a system for the AI to persistently evolve the world state (faction influence, NPC relationships, environmental impacts) based on player actions, supporting long-term world simulation.

9. **Automated Cleanup of Old/Inactive Game Sessions**
   - Activate and configure the cleanupOldGames function to automatically delete old, inactive, or completed game sessions from the database, managing storage costs and data cleanliness.

10. **Backend Implementation of Comprehensive Skill Trees and Character Progression**
    - Develop a backend system for defining, unlocking, and managing character skill trees, advanced stat increases, and complex traits or bonds to deepen character development and progression.

# MythSeeker Premium Technical & Game Design Enhancement Roadmap

Below are 10 premium technical and game design enhancements that would help MythSeeker differentiate itself and stay cutting-edge. These advanced features focus on sophisticated AI, performance, and unique gameplay experiences.

1. **Deep Learning for Adaptive AI DM Evolution**
   - Transition the AI Dungeon Master to a deep learning model that learns from campaign outcomes, player feedback, and emergent narrative branches to autonomously refine storytelling, pacing, and challenge balancing over time.

2. **Modular AI Content Generation Pipeline**
   - Develop a sophisticated backend pipeline orchestrating multiple specialized generative AI models to dynamically create diverse campaign elements (branching quests, NPC backstories, magical artifacts, dungeon layouts) in real-time, tailored to player actions and world state.

3. **Cross-Campaign AI Knowledge Graph & Persistent Memory**
   - Implement a robust knowledge graph and persistent memory for the AI DM across all campaigns and users, accumulating understanding of player archetypes, successful narrative arcs, and effective world-building elements to inform new adventures.

4. **Real-time Game Logic with Latency Compensation**
   - Implement advanced server-side latency compensation and client-side prediction algorithms for multiplayer tactical combat, ensuring smooth, responsive gameplay even with network delays for a premium real-time experience.

5. **Dynamic Game Rule Engine with AI-Driven Adaptation**
   - Develop an intelligent backend system allowing the AI DM to dynamically adjust core game rules and mechanics (combat difficulty, resource scarcity, NPC reactions, environmental hazards) to maintain optimal engagement for the current party.

6. **Secure Decentralized Digital Ownership of In-Game Assets (Web3/Blockchain)**
   - Explore blockchain integration to enable true digital ownership of unique in-game items, characters, or campaign "moments" as NFTs, fostering a player-driven economy and community engagement.

7. **AI-Driven World Events and Faction Simulation**
   - Implement a robust backend system where AI agents continuously simulate background world events, NPC daily routines, and evolving faction politics independently of player interaction, creating a truly "living world" with deep immersion.

8. **Automated AI-Driven Content Evaluation & Testing**
   - Develop an automated testing framework utilizing AI to simulate diverse player behaviors and campaign paths, evaluating narrative coherence, challenge balance, fairness, and overall "fun factor" for continuous quality assurance.

9. **Advanced Performance Optimization for Serverless Backend**
   - Focus on cutting-edge serverless performance strategies including minimizing cold starts, optimizing database queries for high throughput, implementing intelligent caching, and leveraging advanced serverless patterns for seamless scaling.

10. **Modular Microservices Architecture for Game Systems**
    - Refactor critical game systems (combat resolution, quest progression, NPC behavior, item management) into distinct, decoupled microservices to enhance scalability, resilience, and enable independent development of premium features.
