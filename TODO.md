# MythSeeker TODO & Development Plan

## üöÄ **PHASE 4: AUTOMATION & SIMULATION (CURRENT)**

### **4.1 Mock Game Simulation & API Testing** ‚úÖ **MAJOR PROGRESS**
- [x] **Create Mock Game Script** - Node.js script to simulate full gameplay via APIs
- [x] **Test Endpoint** - Created test endpoint that bypasses auth for development
- [x] **Initial Testing** - Achieved 70% success rate in simulation
- [ ] **Combat System Backend API** - Add dedicated combat endpoints
- [ ] **Session Management** - Real-time session state and persistence
- [ ] **Multiplayer Support** - Real-time updates, player synchronization
- [ ] **Performance Testing** - Load testing, response time optimization

### **4.2 Combat System Architecture** ‚ùå **CRITICAL GAP**
- [ ] **Backend Combat State Management**
  - [ ] `startCombat` endpoint
  - [ ] `resolveCombatAction` endpoint  
  - [ ] `getCombatState` endpoint
  - [ ] Combat turn management
  - [ ] Damage calculation
  - [ ] Status effects
- [ ] **Frontend Combat UI Integration**
  - [ ] Fix blank Combat page
  - [ ] Real-time combat updates
  - [ ] Action buttons and targeting
  - [ ] Combat log display

### **4.3 Multiplayer Infrastructure** ‚ùå **CRITICAL GAP**
- [ ] **Real-time Communication**
  - [ ] WebSocket/Firebase Realtime Database integration
  - [ ] Player presence indicators
  - [ ] Live chat system
  - [ ] Shared game state
- [ ] **Session Management**
  - [ ] Game session creation/joining
  - [ ] Player permissions and roles
  - [ ] Session persistence
  - [ ] Auto-save functionality

### **4.4 Performance Optimization** ‚ö†Ô∏è **NEEDS ATTENTION**
- [ ] **API Response Optimization**
  - [ ] Caching strategies
  - [ ] Database query optimization
  - [ ] Rate limiting
- [ ] **Frontend Performance**
  - [ ] Component lazy loading
  - [ ] Virtual scrolling for large lists
  - [ ] Image optimization
  - [ ] Bundle size reduction

## üìã **IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS**

### **Step 1: Fix Character Creation** ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**
- ‚úÖ Created test endpoint for development
- ‚úÖ Fixed authentication issues
- ‚úÖ Achieved 70% success rate in simulation

### **Step 2: Implement Combat System** üéØ **NEXT PRIORITY**
- [ ] Add `startCombat` endpoint to Firebase Functions
- [ ] Add `resolveCombatAction` endpoint
- [ ] Add `getCombatState` endpoint
- [ ] Fix blank Combat page in frontend
- [ ] Integrate combat with AI Dungeon Master

### **Step 3: Add Real-time Multiplayer** üéØ **HIGH PRIORITY**
- [ ] Implement WebSocket connection
- [ ] Add player presence tracking
- [ ] Create live messaging system
- [ ] Add shared game state synchronization

### **Step 4: Performance Optimization** ‚ö†Ô∏è **MEDIUM PRIORITY**
- [ ] Optimize slow endpoints (campaign_setup: 2938ms)
- [ ] Add caching for frequently accessed data
- [ ] Implement rate limiting
- [ ] Add performance monitoring

## üéØ **SUCCESS METRICS**
- [x] Mock game script successfully simulates full gameplay loop
- [ ] Combat system works end-to-end (backend + frontend)
- [ ] Multiplayer sessions support 4+ players simultaneously
- [ ] API response times < 500ms for all endpoints
- [ ] No blank pages or broken functionality

## üîß **TECHNICAL DEBT & CLEANUP**
- [ ] Move hamburger menu to left nav bar
- [ ] Fix scroll issues on all pages
- [ ] Clean up unused imports and variables
- [ ] Add proper error boundaries
- [ ] Implement comprehensive logging

## üìä **SIMULATION RESULTS (Latest Run)**
- **Success Rate**: 70% (7/10 actions successful)
- **Average Response Time**: 542ms
- **Fastest Response**: 141ms
- **Slowest Response**: 2938ms (campaign_setup)
- **Identified Gaps**: 5 major gaps found
- **Recommendations**: 3 key improvements needed

### **Working Features** ‚úÖ
- Campaign creation and management
- Player joining and session management
- AI Dungeon Master responses
- Game progress saving
- Campaign completion

### **Broken Features** ‚ùå
- Character creation (ID conflict issue)
- Combat system (not implemented)
- Real-time multiplayer (not implemented)

### **Performance Issues** ‚ö†Ô∏è
- Campaign setup is slow (2938ms)
- Some endpoints need optimization
