# MythSeeker TODO & Development Plan

## ðŸš€ **PHASE 4: AUTOMATION & SIMULATION (CURRENT)**

### **4.1 Mock Game Simulation & API Testing**
- [ ] **Create Mock Game Script** - Node.js script to simulate full gameplay via APIs
- [ ] **Combat System Backend API** - Add dedicated combat endpoints
- [ ] **Session Management** - Real-time session state and persistence
- [ ] **Multiplayer Support** - Real-time updates, player synchronization
- [ ] **Performance Testing** - Load testing, response time optimization

### **4.2 Combat System Architecture**
- [ ] **Backend Combat State Management**
  - [ ] `startCombat` endpoint
  - [ ] `resolveCombatAction` endpoint  
  - [ ] `getCombatState` endpoint
  - [ ] Combat turn management
  - [ ] Damage calculation
  - [ ] Status effects
- [ ] **Frontend Combat UI Integration**
  - [ ] Fix blank Combat page
  - [ ] Real-time combat updates
  - [ ] Action buttons and targeting
  - [ ] Combat log display

### **4.3 Multiplayer Infrastructure**
- [ ] **Real-time Communication**
  - [ ] WebSocket/Firebase Realtime Database integration
  - [ ] Player presence indicators
  - [ ] Live chat system
  - [ ] Shared game state
- [ ] **Session Management**
  - [ ] Game session creation/joining
  - [ ] Player permissions and roles
  - [ ] Session persistence
  - [ ] Auto-save functionality

### **4.4 Performance Optimization**
- [ ] **API Response Optimization**
  - [ ] Caching strategies
  - [ ] Database query optimization
  - [ ] Rate limiting
- [ ] **Frontend Performance**
  - [ ] Component lazy loading
  - [ ] Virtual scrolling for large lists
  - [ ] Image optimization
  - [ ] Bundle size reduction

## ðŸ“‹ **IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS**

### **Step 1: Create Mock Game Simulation Script**
```bash
# Create test script
mkdir -p scripts
touch scripts/mock-game-simulation.js
```

### **Step 2: Fix Combat Page**
- Investigate why Combat page is blank
- Add proper combat state management
- Integrate with backend combat API

### **Step 3: Add Missing Backend APIs**
- Combat system endpoints
- Session management
- Real-time multiplayer support

### **Step 4: Performance Testing**
- Load test with multiple simulated players
- Measure response times
- Optimize bottlenecks

## ðŸŽ¯ **SUCCESS METRICS**
- [ ] Mock game script successfully simulates full gameplay loop
- [ ] Combat system works end-to-end (backend + frontend)
- [ ] Multiplayer sessions support 4+ players simultaneously
- [ ] API response times < 500ms for all endpoints
- [ ] No blank pages or broken functionality

## ðŸ”§ **TECHNICAL DEBT & CLEANUP**
- [ ] Move hamburger menu to left nav bar
- [ ] Fix scroll issues on all pages
- [ ] Clean up unused imports and variables
- [ ] Add proper error boundaries
- [ ] Implement comprehensive logging
